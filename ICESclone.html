                            Established in the year 2011, the American Society of Civil Engineers(ISSR), VIT Student Chapter has been proficient in its portrayal of a student chapter exclusively dedicated for Civil Engineering in the college. With various events, guest lectures and workshops, ASCE - VIT has managed to attract a large number of the student population. With the advent of a national level symposium ‘Structura 2013’ and three international civil engineering symposiums (ICES'14, ICES'15 & ICES'16), the chapter has reached new heights, now being a common name amidst various civil engineering circles. We seek to attain overall excellence and carry out the mission of ASCE and thus make our presence felt amongst the charts of various ASCE Chapters around the world.
